		<h2>About Futurama</h2>
		</div>
		<div>		
		<p> 
			Futurama is an adult cartoon television show created by Matt Groening. 
			Unlike Groening’s better known work, The Simpsons, Futurama is a science fiction comedy that is mainly based in the early 31st century. 
			This futuristic story begins when Philip J. Fry (a.k.a. Fry), a pizza delivery boy in New York City, accidentally falls into a cryogenic freezer. 
			He wakes up in the next millennium where he intends to start living a better life than he did beforehand. 
			However, Fry ends up working as a delivery boy at an interplanetary shipping company called Planet Express. 
			From that point on, the show tracks the lives of the main character and his fellow coworkers as they complete odd deliveries across the universe and develops strong bonds of friendship.

		<h2>My Top 5 Characters</h2>
		</div>
	
		<h2>#5: Amy Wong</h2>
			<img src="amy.png" alt= "Amy Wong">
				<h3><strong>About Amy Wong</strong></h3>
					<p> 
						Amy Wong, a student at Mars University and intern at Planet express, is a main character in the Futurama series.
						Though she doesn’t receive as much “air time” as her fellow coworkers in the series, she still contributes a lot of funny and entertaining content towards the show. 
						She is a promiscuous and youthful character of East Asian ancestry whose parents are wealthy ranch owners on the planet of Mars.
						It is there where her family raises creatures called “buggalo”, a giant combination of a ladybug and a buffalo.
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Why I Like Her Character</strong></h3>
					<p>
						One of the main reasons I like Amy is that I find her situation to be quite humorous and relatable. 
						She receives constant pressure from her parents to find a suitable spouse to provide them with grandchildren, and no matter who she brings home, her parents are never satisfied. 
						Also, she often refers to her previous self as being dramatically overweight, allowing her character to be relatable to young obese viewers. 
						This fact about Amy can inspire them to see a future transformation in themselves and not give up on becoming healthy.
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Favorite Quote</strong></h3>
					<p> "Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents said if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar. And I got all C's!" - Amy Wong </p>

		<h2>#4: Lord Nibbler</h2>
			<img src="nibbler.jpg" alt= "Lord Nibbler">
				<h3><strong>About Lord Nibbler</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Unlike the other characters on this list, Lord Nibbler is only a secondary character. He has two roles in the series. 
						First, he is often seen as Leela’s house pet, where he doesn’t do much besides mumble in an indistinguishable language, excrete dark matter, and look cute. 
						However, there are certain episodes where the true identity of Lord Nibbler is revealed. 
						He is actually a naval captain who speaks English in a deep manly voice and often enlists his friends at Planet Express to assist him in his efforts of saving the world. 
					</p>
				<h3><strong>Why I Like His Character</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Lord Nibbler is one of my favorite characters on the show for a couple reasons. 
						Firstly, he is a little, cute cartoon whose daily life consists of nothing more than living the life of a dog.
						Because of this, the fact that he tries to go on these world-saving missions is hilariously comedic. 
						Secondly, Nibbler’s character provokes the interesting thought that maybe our house pets here on Earth are secretly pretending to be unintelligent, yet have secret motives of their own. 
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Favorite Quote</strong></h3>
					<p> "Possible, my people live long and are celebrated poopers." - Lord Nibbler </p>

		<h2>#3: Turanga Leela (a.k.a. Leela)</h2>
			<img src="leela.jpg" alt= "Turanga Leela">
				<h3><strong>About Turanga Leela</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Turanga Leela is one of the more vital characters in the Futurama series. 
						She is not only one of the first people that Fry comes into contact with upon exiting the cryogenic freezer, but is also one of his best friends.
						She is the captain of the Planet Express ship and is responsible for the safety of the deliveries and the crew. 
						Though she is a mutant human (which explains her lack of a second eye), it still doesn’t keep Fry from falling in love with her. 
					</p>
				<h3><strong>Why I Like Her Character</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Leela is a well-rounded yet realistic character with both likeable and unlikeable characteristics. 
						On one end, she is intelligent, hardworking, and is passionate about things she believes in (i.e. caring for the environment, helping orphans, etc.). 
						However, like many feminists in modern times, she has tendencies to develop a strong and annoying ego, which makes me cringe. 
						Despite this, her value to the series and to Fry makes her one of my favorite characters.
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Favorite Quote</strong></h3>
					<p> "Look, I don't know about your previous captains, but I intend to do as little dying as possible" - Leela </p>

		<h2>#2: Bender</h2>
			<img src="bender.png" alt= "Bender">
				<h3><strong>About Bender</strong></h3>
					<p>
						Bender is also a very important character to the Futurama series. 
						Originally designed to be a bending robot (a robot that bends metal), Bender’s main function at Planet Express is to be a lousy chef, a trouble maker, and couch potato. 
						Though he doesn’t do much and often causes more problems than he fixes, Bender is Fry’s best friend, and therefore is allowed to stick around. 
					</p>
				<h3><strong>Why I Like His Character</strong></h3>
					<p>
					The main reason I like Bender as a character is because of his comedic, egocentric, and absurd personality. 
					He is always seen drinking and smoking cigars, which while unhealthy for humans, is necessary for him to survive. 
					He is flirtatious with almost every female robot, which often gets him in trouble with the parents/husbands of those robots.
					Also, Bender is often planning some sort of heist in which he can steal money or jewelry from anyone. 
					No one is safe from Bender’s crazy adventures and schemes.
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Favorite Quote</strong></h3>
					<p> "I hope he didn’t die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor, then I hope he did die."  - Bender </p>

		<h2>#1: Philip J. Fry (a.k.a. Fry)</h2>
			<img src="fry.png" alt= "Philip J. Fry">
				<h3><strong>About Philip J. Fry</strong></h3>
					<p>
						My most favorite character in all of the Futurama series is Philip J. Fry.
						Fry, who originates from the 20th century, is an accidental time traveler who retains his job as a delivery boy. 
						He often goes on wild and crazy adventures with his coworkers at Planet Express, on many of which he tries to impress his crush, Leela. 
						Though not very intelligent or hardworking, Fry’s personality is essential towards the everyday functions at Planet Express. 
					</p>
				<h3><strong>Why I Like His Character</strong></h3>
					<p>
					Fry is my favorite character because he is perhaps the most relatable.
					Many of us are not geniuses, models, or trust-fund kids, so we all have to endure the same struggles.
					Though he was dealt a bad hand, Fry is usually optimistic, seeing the best in everyone and every situation. 
					It is because of these characteristics that I find myself closely resembling Fry.  
					</p>
					<h3><strong>Favorite Quote</strong></h3>
						<p> "People said I was dumb, but I proved them." - Fry </p>
